### Expectation for C4C Product Members

1. Product team members are expected to contribute to a C4C project until the delivery date of their assigned project which will be set near the end of the academic year.
2. If a product team member no longer wants to remain in C4C, does not want to return to C4C the following semester, or can no longer consistently contribute because of other obligations, they should tell their project manager as soon as possible.
3. Product team members that are not returning to C4C should make themselves available for an exit interview with the Director of Recruitment and Engagement.
4. C4C members will use the Slack workspace (c4cneuteams.slack.com) as the primary form of communication. All members should regularly check their Slack messages and respond to any messages within a 48 hour time frame, or whatever is deemed reasonable by their team.
5. Product team members are expected to collaborate in a meeting with another C4C product team member once every week to advance the goal of a C4C project through pair programming, code walks, code reviews, or another similarly product-focused activity.
6. Product team developers, unless explicitly given a non-coding assignment, are expected to push code to a remote project repository at least once a week.
7. If a member is unable to contribute to C4C for a given week because of an illness, family emergency, overwhelming professional or scholarly obligations, or any other reason, they are expected to communicate that to their project manager as soon as possible.
8. If a member isn’t respecting the team expectations, then a Project Lead will give them two verbal warnings throughout a semester. If the member does not have a reasonable excuse for their actions, and continues to not respect team expectations, they will be asked to leave C4C.

### Expectations for the C4C Organization

1. C4C is an elective activity and will work to create a fun and engaging environment for its members.
2. C4C will always welcome any developer to the C4C community who has joined and contributed to a C4C project, past or present.
3. C4C will ensure its members are given proper guidance and training so that they can effectively contribute to their projects.
4. C4C will teach its members through C4C resources and guides and by assigning product work that is meaningful and that our members can learn from.
5. C4C will support its member’s professional careers by providing resources on the different stages of the co-op application process and by showcasing its members to potential employers.
6. C4C will support its member’s academic goals by creating an environment of learning and sharing helpful experiences as fellow Northeastern undergraduate students.
7. Project leads will schedule biweekly meetings to meet individually with product team members to address any ideas, questions, or concerns.
8. If a C4C member feels like the Code4Community organization is not respecting the club expectations, then they should bring this to the attention of a Club or Project Lead and it will be made the first point of order at the next All Hands meeting.
