## What is a Shell/Terminal

The terminal is a really important tool, which you'll find extremely useful throughout your
development career. Not only does it allow you to access settings and commands which you would otherwise
not have access to, it is sometimes just easier to be able to do some things by typing out commands
rather than pointing and clicking with a mouse. 

Learning how to use the terminal may take a while, you can get started with a few commands
we think every developer should know. We'll also show you how to build your projects if you
haven't tried doing that yet.

# Common Commands

The terminal is a tool which uses specific commands to perform system-level actions. The way that it works
is each terminal instance (tab/window) works in a specific directory (folder), and a lot of the commands utilize the
files in the given directory or a subdirectory. The actual terminal syntax depends on which 'shell', or
command language/interface, is being used. The Windows operating system uses the Command Prompt as a shell,
while Mac and Linux often use BASH (Bourne Again SHell) as a shell.

It's a bit long, but it should give you a pretty solid understanding of how to use the terminal and some
common commands.
