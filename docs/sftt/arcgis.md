ArcGIS has map data

Backend has it's own db

Requests go from frontend to backend to arcgis. 

Data in our database isn't used at all to display on the map itself, that comes from ArcGIS. 

Parallel Data Structures

Multiple Maps:
- My Blocks: your reserved blocks
- Admin

Local Dev Problems: 
- People can't update 


TLDR: architecture
