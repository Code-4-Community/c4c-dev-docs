# C4C Dev Docs

Welcome to Code4Community's documentation site. The goal of this site is to be a common resource for all product team members that describes different workflows and application architectures. 

If you're new around here, you'll want to start with the [Getting Started](./getting-started/index.md) section, which describes how to run and develop our applications on your local machine, in addition to some higher-level product development workflow guides. 

Each project we've created additionally has its own documentation page. This includes things like application architecture, API route specifications, and (later) even more! 

This documentation is always a work-in-progress, as our needs, our partner's needs, and our technical needs change over time. If at any point you find something that could be explained more clearly or is missing entirely, send a message in Slack noting this, and head over [here](./getting-started/mkdocs-starter.md) to learn how to contribute to this site.
