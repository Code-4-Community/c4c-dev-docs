# Getting Started with Code4Community

This section is called getting started, but it's not just for new developers - if anyone has a better name, feel free to submit a pull request :)

The goal of this section is to detail how to work well as a team member of Code4Community. It includes how to set up our applications, as well as some higher-level product development workflow guides. There's so much more that can be added, so please be communicative in Slack about what would help you if it were included here, or add some documentation yourself.
