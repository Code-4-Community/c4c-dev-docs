For people unfamiliar with mkdocs and it's powers, [this](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/reference/abbreviations/) is pretty extensive 

## Git Overview

### GitHub Pages
-are you doing this too @Floris

### Clone 
You can clone a repository by going to the repo's page;

```
What's a repository? It's a directory or a storage space where your projects can live. Every time you create a Git project, there will be a `./git` folder which keeps track of all your changes and builds your work history over time. If you delete the `./git` folder, your project's history will also be deleted.
```
There, you will see different buttons, including a green button labeled "Code." If you click on it, you are able to access the repository's link and can copy it by clicking on the button right next to the link, or selecting and copying the link manually.

Once you are at your dev environment (for today we're using Visual Studio Code), we can open a terminal (from the top menu) and type in `git clone [repo address]` like the picture below and hit enter.

### Pull Requests
A pull request is a an event in Git where a contributor will ask the maintainer of a Git repository to review code that they want to merge into a project. Pull requests show differences between the content; the changes, additions, and subtractions are shown in green and red. Once a pull request is opened, you can discuss and review potential changes. If a pull request is approved, it will merge your changes directly into the main repository.
