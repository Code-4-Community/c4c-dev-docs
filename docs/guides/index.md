# Best Practices and Guides

In this section, you'll find the best practices that we as an organization follow in our software development. In addition to general best practices, there are guides around some of the higher-level concepts and frameworks in our applications. 

These guides don't cover the fundamentals. Fundamentals currently live on the Jumpstart website at [learn.c4cneu.com](https://learn.c4cneu.com). It's also linked in the sidebar on the left for easy access. Over time, some of those resources will make their way onto this site and be updated to be specific to our internal applications. Even if you're an experienced developer, there's probably something on the Jumpstart site that you don't know, so take a look!
